After this  You may change the ticket to resolved and u may repeat it for more practice but the lab is concluded

 ðŸ“ˆ Why This Matters
This lab shows practical help desk operations, not just tool setup:
- SLA assignment & prioritization = real IT triage
- User-agent communication = key Tier 1 skill
- Closing tickets with notes = critical for documentation & handoffs

This mirrors exactly what IT Support Specialists do in real environments like:
- MSPs (Managed Service Providers)
- Internal IT help desks
- School districts, hospitals, corporate offices

---

## ðŸ§ª Lessons Learned
- Proper SLA assignment helps ensure urgent issues are handled first.
- Good documentation keeps tickets clean and reduces escalations.
- Practicing ticket workflows builds speed and confidence for real jobs.
